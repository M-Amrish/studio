## Core Features:

- Manual Input of Building Parameters: Allows users to manually enter building details like name, location, family size, and roof dimensions. AI is used as a tool to automatically extract rooftop dimensions from uploaded building blueprints.
- Automatic GIS-based Data Retrieval: Uses GPS and GIS to automatically detect rooftop size from satellite imagery, fetch local rainfall data from IMD, and gather aquifer details from CGWB and GIS datasets.
- Water Harvesting Potential Calculation: Estimates annual water harvesting potential based on rooftop area, rainfall, and runoff coefficient. Also recommends suitable RTRWH/Recharge structures.
- Feasibility Report Generation: Generates a feasibility report (YES/NO) with a confidence score, suggested structure type, recommended tank material, water collection estimate, groundwater recharge potential, and aquifer details.
- Cost-Benefit Analysis: Estimates the cost and performs a cost-benefit analysis, projecting investment versus savings.
- Output Display via Visual Dashboards: Presents results via card-based layout and charts for easy understanding.
- Report Export: Allows users to download/share feasibility reports as PDFs.
